                    <h3>STUDIES</h3>
                    <p>I am currently an undergrad at the University of Michigan in the school of Literature, Science, and Arts. 
                    I intend to graduate in May 2016 with a BA in Organizational Studies and German. This summer I am headed off to India to begin 
                    my honors thesis research on how entrepreneurial nonprofits empower women.</p>

                    <h3>CAREER</h3>
                    <p>What are my plans after graduation? After working in consulting, process improvement, or marketing 
                        I plan to open a business focused on people, supported by innovative technology and processes. While I 
                        do not know exactly what type of business I want to found I do know that I love to create media, 
                        teach people, and find strategies to be efficient. </p>

                    <h3>CLASSES</h3>
                    <p>What am I really studying? Here are a few classes I've taken at UofM: Nonprofit Management,
                     Organizational Psychology and Theory, Positively Leading Change, Business German, German Marketing, Germany in the EU, German Politics
                        Since 1945, Programming (C++ and Python), Agile Website Development, Networking Theory and Analysis, and Complex Systems. 
                    You may notice this is a strange mix of classes. Indeed I love to learn both 'hard' and 'soft' skills. Learning technology is important to 
                    me as I believe it will help be a better manager or entrepreneur. My organizational studies major allows for flexibility in order to learn this.

                    <p>I have had the wonderful opportunity to work at Quicken Loans as a Servicing Training Media Intern where 
                        I created training videos, animated tutorials, created books with inDesign, and developed and implemented 
                        a team building curriculum. </p>

                        <p>I have worked many years at my mother's gallery, Lake Effect. Though I wore many 'hats'
                        each day, my primary roles involved customer service, sales, and accounting procedures. Other roles included being an 
                        event hostess, doing fine arts frame design, and playing piano at receptions. </p>

                     <p>In the 2012-2013 school year I was America Reads one-on-one reading and 
                        writing tutor at Bennett Elementary School in Detroit. This included lesson planning and carrying out assessments. 
                        I chose this position to better understand issues in the Detroit school system and to get experience with teaching.
                        A professor once told me "If you can teach a rabble of kindergarteners, you can manage businessmen and women." </p>

                    <p> During my freshman year I worked at Kresge Research Insitute as a research assistant. This involved histology, crossectioning, 
                        creating animations, presentations, posters, and correcting articles to be published. 
                        I am published in a BDNA research article and received undergraduate superior presentation award. </p>
