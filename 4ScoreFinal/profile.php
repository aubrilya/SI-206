					<p class="h3 fancy m3">"Calling all dames in these great states. Are you looking for a dashing, strong, dominant man who can sweep you up into the billows of a most pleasurable rendezvous? There is no greater womanizer than the 7th prez! I was a Revolutionary War prisoner, ex-lawyer, and I started servingin Congress at 29 for gods sake! I've owned slaves and a cotton plantation in Tennessee. I relocated the Native Americans but adopted 2 of'em-so I'm a true humanitarian. I've never weighed over 145 pounds and I've suffered from smallpox, depression, malaria, dysentery, dropsy but hey a little illness never killed nobody. I was also the first prez to ride a train. Rachel just doesn't do it for me in the bedroom, sigh."  <!--100 character headline:-->
